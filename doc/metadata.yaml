abstract: |
  We propose how to construct knowledge graphs using a method based on user requirements formulated as competency questions.
  It suggests to formalize the competency questions as SPARQL queries wrapped as SHACL constraints allowing them to be used as automated tests.
  The method defines a process to guide knowledge graph construction based on feedback from tests.
  It aims to reduce the engineering effort required to construct a knowledge graph that meets the requirements, while assessing the quality of semantic artifacts produced in this effort.
  We intend the method to provide a solid engineering basis for knowledge graph construction using the lessons learnt from software development and based on open standards.
  We demonstrate using the method on construction of a knowledge graph about antigen covid tests.
